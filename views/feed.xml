				<description><![CDATA[ Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassem announced the proposed  investments at a joint press conference with Egyptian Prime Minister  Hisham Kandil on September 6. This new wave of investment comes on the  heels of a $2 billion Qatari loan to the Egyptian state, the first  installment of which was deposited at the Central Bank of Egypt on  August 23.
The announcement came just a week after Mursi made headlines at the  Non-Aligned Movement summit in Tehran when he announced his full support  for the Syrian revolution against what he called an &ldquo;oppressive  regime.&rdquo; ]]></description>

Whether this  influx of Gulf money was the goal behind Cairo&rsquo;s posturing or rather the  loan and investments were a result of Mursi&rsquo;s anti-Syrian position,  which has broad support at home, no one can say. At least some factions  in Egypt, including the Hazemoun movement linked to former Salafi  presidential candidate Hazem Abu Ismail, view the Syrian uprising  through a religious, sectarian lens as a jihad against an &ldquo;infidel&rdquo;  Alawi army.Many in the region see a link between Egypt&rsquo;s unyielding stance on Syria  and the recent spike in Qatari investments in Egypt.

				<description><![CDATA[ Qatar is a small country that needs strong allies, said Ibrahim, but its  relationships with its direct neighbors &ndash; Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq &ndash;  are fraught with difficulties. An ally in Egypt would not covet Qatari  resources, making it a safe and powerful friend. In addition to  increasing its political clout, Qatar also sees Egypt as a ripe  investment opportunity. ]]></description>
